# CCCoreLib

[![Actions Status](https://github.com/CloudCompare/CCCoreLib/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/CloudCompare/CCCoreLib/actions)

This library provides data structures and algorithms for working with 3D point cloud data.

It was originally part of the [CloudCompare repository](https://github.com/CloudCompare/CloudCompare) (as "CCLib").

We have separated it into its own repository because it is useful on its own without having to download the entire CloudCompare repository. This makes it easier to work with and gives this part of the CloudCompare project some visibility it would not otherwise have.

It uses CMake, requires C++14, and compiles & runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## Main CMake Options

| Option        | Description | Default  |
| ------------- |-------------| ---------|
| CC-CORE-LIB_USE_CGAL | Use CGAL to enable Delaunay 2.5D triangulation with a GPL compliant licence | OFF |
| CC-CORE-LIB_USE_TBB | Use Intel Threading Building Blocks lib to enable some parallel processing | OFF |
| CC-CORE-LIB_USE_QT | Use Qt to enable parallel processing using QtConcurrent | ON |
| CC-CORE-LIB_SHARED | Compile as a shared library | ON |
| CC-CORE-LIB_SCALAR_DOUBLE | Define _ScalarType_ as double (instead of float) | OFF |
