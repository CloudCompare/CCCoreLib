# CCCoreLib

[![Actions Status](https://github.com/CloudCompare/CCCoreLib/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/CloudCompare/CCCoreLib/actions)

This library provides data structures and algorithms for working with 3D point cloud data.

It was originally part of the [CloudCompare repository](https://github.com/CloudCompare/CloudCompare) (as "CCLib").

We have separated it into its own repository because it is useful on its own without having to download the entire CloudCompare repository. This makes it easier to work with and gives this part of the CloudCompare project some visibility it would not otherwise have.

It uses CMake, requires C++14, and compiles & runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## Main CMake Options

| Option        | Description | Default  |
| ------------- |-------------| ---------|
| CCCORELIB_USE_CGAL | Use [CGAL](https://github.com/CGAL/cgal) to enable Delaunay 2.5D triangulation with a GPL compliant licence | OFF |
| CCCORELIB_USE_TBB | Use [Intel Threading Building Blocks](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB) lib to enable some parallel processing | OFF |
| CCCORELIB_USE_QT_CONCURRENT | Use Qt to enable parallel processing using [QtConcurrent](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtconcurrent-index.html) | ON |
| CCCORELIB_SHARED | Compile as a shared library | ON |
| CCCORELIB_SCALAR_DOUBLE | Define _ScalarType_ as double (instead of float) | OFF |

### Qt Option (Qt5_DIR)

If `CCCORELIB_USE_QT_CONCURRENT` is on (it is by default), then you may need to tell CMake where to find the Qt cmake files. The [official docs from Qt](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/cmake-get-started.html) show two ways to do so:
- setting `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` to point to your Qt installation (where 'bin', 'doc', 'include', lib', etc. live)
- setting `Qt5_DIR` to point at the cmake directory within your Qt installation (this would be something like `<Qt installation>/cmake/Qt5`)

From this, cmake will determine `Qt5Concurrent_DIR`, `Qt5Core_DIR`, and `Qt5Widgets_DIR`, so there's no need to set those explicitly.

Using SPDX enables machine processing of license information based on the [SPDX License Identifiers](https://spdx.org/ids) and makes it easier for developers to see at a glance which license they are dealing with.

### License Special Note
Two files (BoundingBox.cpp and RayAndBox.h) were previously licensed under the **GPL 2.0+** license by mistake - see the [LICENSE-GPL-2.0](LICENSE-GPL-2.0.txt) file for details.
